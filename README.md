# Age Distribution Analysis: Left-Handed vs Right-Handed Individuals

This data analysis project aims to examine the age distribution of individuals at the time of their death, specifically focusing on the comparison between left-handed and right-handed individuals. The commonly held belief that left-handers tend to have a shorter lifespan has been challenged by researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki. They propose that the observed difference in death age is primarily influenced by changing societal attitudes towards left-handedness across different generations. 

The primary objective of this project is to utilize Bayesian statistics to investigate the probability of individuals being a certain age at the time of their death, considering their handedness. Additionally, the project aims to assess the statistical significance of the reported age difference between left-handers and right-handers.

## Datasets

The project relies on two primary datasets:

1. **Left-Handedness Rates**: This dataset includes information on the rates of left-handedness among various age groups, allowing for an examination of how the prevalence of left-handedness has evolved over time.

2. **Death Distribution Data**: This dataset consists of death distribution data specifically for the United States in the year 1999. It provides valuable insights into the number of individuals who passed away at each age during that period.

By combining these datasets, the project aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the age distribution of left-handed and right-handed individuals at the time of their death.
